# SpreadJS Microsoft Excel Mobile Clone Sample

This is a web application built with the GrapeCity Spread.Sheets JavaScript Spreadsheet component. It mimics much of the functionality and UI you see in with Microsoft Windows Store Excel application. This application was built to showcase the features and extensibility you will find in Spread.Sheets. 

Notes: 
* The spreadsheet area is built with Spread.Sheets
* The UI implements Spread.Sheets features
* The tabs show examples of features you can use
* The app loads and saves files in .ssjson format. Excel import / export will come soon
